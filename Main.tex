    \begin{itemize}
        \item Due to heat transfer, temperature field is set up in the material which induces thermal stresses in the body.
\item These stresses becomes large in the vicinity of a discontinuity i.e. crack tip. If temperature variation is sufficiently large, it can lead to failure.
        \item Applications: Nuclear power plants, cylinder-nozzle
 intersection in pressure vessels, aerodynamic heating of high-speed aircraft, ultra fast pulse lasers etc.

    \item Atkinson has solved the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation on a pie shaped region as $u(x,y)= r^{\frac{\pi}{\phi}}\sin\alpha\theta,\  r>0,\ 0<\theta<\phi$
        \begin{itemize}
                \footnotesize
    \item If $0<\phi<\pi$:
        The first partial derivative of u with respect to x and y remains continuous as we approach towards the origin. 
    \item If $\pi<\phi<2\pi$:
        The first derivative u with respect to x and y are not continuous as (x,y) approaches the origin. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item When $\phi=2\pi$, the problem becomes a crack problem and displacement and derivative of displacement vary as $u \propto r^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $u'\propto  r^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ respectively. 
    \item As thermo-elastic problems are also governed by Laplace's equation, temperature will vary as $r^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and heat fluxes will be unbounded at the crack tip.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Our main concern in case of thermally loaded fracture problems is to find the stress intensity factors. Methods for calculating stress intensity factors in FEM can be divided in two categories,
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Substitution method 
                \item Energy method 
            \end{itemize}
        \item In substitution method, we can get the SIF's as:
            \footnotesize
            $$ u=\frac{1+\nu}{4E}\sqrt{\frac{2r}{\pi}}\left\{ K_I\left[ (2\kappa -1)\cos \frac{\theta}{2}-\cos \frac{3\theta}{2} \right]+K_{II}\left[ (2\kappa +3)\sin\frac{\theta}{2}+\sin\frac{3\theta}{2} \right] \right\}$$
            \normalsize
A similar equation exist for $v$ also. 
        \item Using energy method, SIF's can be calculated as$^\ast$ 
            \footnotesize
$$G=-\frac{d\Pi}{da}\ ,\ \ \ \ \ \  
\Pi=-\frac{1}{2}{u}^T[K]{u}+\frac{1}{2}\int{\varepsilon_0}^T[D]{\varepsilon_0}dV$$

\item In XFEM, we enrich the polynomial approximation to include the effects of singular discontinuous field.
    \item Advantages:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mesh is prepared without considering the existence of discontinuity.

          \begin{itemize}

        \item Tangent level set, $\phi(x)=$ the signed distance to the plane including the crack front and perpendicular to the crack surface.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item If $\phi < 0 $ and $\psi_{min}\psi_{max}\leq 0$, nodes should be enriched with $h(x)$.
